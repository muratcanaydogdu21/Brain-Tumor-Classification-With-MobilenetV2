# Brain-Tumor-Classification-With-MobilenetV2
In this repository, deep learning was used to predict the type of tumor based on brain MRI images using data sets found on Kaggle. MobilenetV2 was chosen as the model. MobilenetV2 is a modern convolutional neural network architecture known for its high accuracy, low computational cost, .
